                    <p>
                        For most people a trip to the grocery store might not be much of a task. Your shopping list might be simple listing
                        the items for todays dinner, and as soon as you find the items you need you are ready to go. However, many people who
                        live with disabilities, mental and/or physical, that require them to pay extra attention to what the products they buy
                        contain. Some might suffer from allergies to specific ingredients while others might have special dietary needs due to sickness or disability.
                        <br>
                        <br> Reseach have found that those who are suffering from mental disabilities often also have problems related to
                        nutrition and need to be extra attentive of what they eat on a daily basis <sup><a href="#referanse_jakobsen"
                       aria-label="link to full referance" class="ref">[1]</a></sup>. For them going through a package description might
                        prove difficulties due to cognitive impairment. In general, small print on packages combined with excessive
                        information makes it a difficult and time consuming task to skim through it all. We aim to solve this problem
                        and make grocery shopping easy for everyone.

                                which is an effect of their syndrome <sup><a href="#referanse_ndss" aria-label="link to full referance" class="ref">[3]</a></sup>.

                                Type 2 diabetes can be regulated and treated with a healthy diet as well as a strict regulation of sugar intake.
                                By regulating the amount of simple carbohydrates such as pasta and food with high sugar content which lead to glucose spikes,

                        Our solution is FoodWiz, an app which lets you scan the barcode on your groceries when you are out shopping.
                        The app will give you the specific information you are seeking which makes it easier for you to find a suitable product.
                        The app also has adjustable settings to set according to your dietary needs.

                        You start by opening the app which leads you directly to the set-up menu for first time users,
                        from there you can set your preferences in accordance with your needs. After putting in the needed data you’re ready to go.
                        After the initial set up it will directly go to scan mode when you open the app.
                        <br>
                        <br> In settings you can alter how the app displays it’s feedback. For someone with a food allergy it will be sufficient to know
                        if the products contains the ingredient they are avoiding or not. In this case a red cross will appear on the screen
                        along with a short vibration to signalize that the products contains the ingredient. If the ingredient is not there
                        it will display a green circle without vibration.
                        <br>
                        <br> For someone who need to know the specific amount of e.g carbohydrates and how much of those are sugars,
                        the app will display the specific numbers and information they need. The information is displayed with simple symbols
                        which are easy to understand even for someone who does not understand the meaning of the text.
                        <br>
                        <br> In all these cases you are able to tap on the information sign for more detailed information as well as
                        suggestions to similar products more suitable to your needs.
                        <br>
                        <br> Our app FoodWiz is made with the cooperation of the largest food store chains in Norway, such as Tine,
                        Orcla Foods and so on. With the approved data of these major companies the app can accurately display the needed data
                        for the intended user. This way we secure accurate and reliable information which is continuously updated as products are altered.

                        <br>
                        <br> We have included features such as text to speech for those with difficulties to see or read.
                        Through the use of simple icons along with the feedback we are including those with mental disabilities who might have trouble understanding
                        what the numbers really mean. From our example above we can image that it might be difficult to understand
                        what it means if a product contains “350kcal pr 100gr” for someone with Downs Syndrome. In the apps setting the
                        person can set personal limit values in cooperation with their physician. This way a warning triangle might appear
                        if the value exceeds a certain amount, while a red cross appears if it exceeds the maximum limit.
